# Overview

Hello! My name is Lucas and i'm a third years Game Development student at the Mediacollege Amsterdam.</br>
Currently living in Amsterdam for a solid 19 years, my general hobbies include, Games, History, Science Fiction and Drums.</br>
I am fluent in Dutch and English.</br>
I've thus far worked with C#, C++, NodeJS, JS, Unity, GML and GameMaker 2.</br>
Besides software development I am familiar with SCRUM methods and know how to make and use Game Design Documents, Trello's and One page designs.</br>

The languages I have the most experience with are C# and C++.
I have about 2.3 years of development on my name.
The thing I love the most is backend development, throwing and efficiently managing data is what I want to achieve!

### Active Projects
-[Warhammer 40K themed Strategy Game](https://github.com/Shaw358/Wh40K) my best work so far. Currently loose mechanics but it will be a prototype of the game by the 1st of December. After that i'm taking a step back from the game. (Solo)
</br>
-[Phantom Keys](https://youtu.be/SIgHoW8nsvw) A project i'm working on with several devs, artists and composers (team of 9). Repo is private per the project leaders wishes, the link will lead to a youtube video of me testing a prototype i made for the battle system. </br>
