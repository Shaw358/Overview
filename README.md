# Overview

Hello! My name is Lucas and i'm a third years Game Development student at the Mediacollege Amsterdam.</br>
I've thus far worked with C#, C++, NodeJS, JS, Unity, GML and GameMaker 2.

The languages I have the most experience with are C# and C++.
I have about 2.3 years of development on my name with many more to come.
The thing i love the most is backend development, throwing and effectively managing data is what i want to achieve!
